An app which predicts the tempereature by number of cricket chirps in 25 seconds
THE CRICKET AS A THERMOMETER Back in 1897, a scientist named Amos Dolbear published an article “The Cricket as a Thermometer” that noted the correlation between the ambient temperature and the rate at which crickets chirp. The formula expressed in that article became known as Dolbear’s Law. It’s surprisingly simple: To convert cricket chirps to degrees Fahrenheit: Just count the number of chirps in 14 seconds, then add 40 to get the temperature. The number you get will be an approximation of the outside temperature. Example: 30 chirps + 40 = 70° F To convert cricket chirps to degrees Celsius: Count the number of chirps in 25 seconds, divide by 3, then add 4 to get the temperature. Example: 48 chirps /(divided by) 3 + 4 = 20° C.
